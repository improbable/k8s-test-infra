#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# This sourcable script provides a standard script environment setup.
# It should be sourced directly from runnable scripts, using a line like:
#
#   # to use, fix path from running script's directory to setup.sh
#   source "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../ci/lib/setup.sh"
#
# Any script sourcing this should have a usage comment, where each line starts
# with a double-hash, i.e. "##":
#
#   #!/usr/bin/env bash
#   # See https://brevi.link/shell-style and https://explainshell.com
#   ## Script that does a thing
#   ## Usage: script.sh <arg>
#   ## Etc...
#   source "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../lib/setup.sh"
#
# Sourcing this script will ensure -h/--help flags have been processed, and
# following globals are defined:
#
# - START_DIR, the original working dir when the script was invoked.
# - SCRIPT_DIR, the directory of the script that was invoked.
# - TOP_SCRIPT, the full path of the original script being invoked.
# - print_usage, function that prints usage info from file comments as
#   described above.
# - the functions from ci/lib/log.sh
#
# Additionally, this will cause unhandled errors to print ugly stack traces and
# exit the (sub)shell. Errors should be handled using constructs such as:
#   some_cmd || log_fatal "Failed to run some command"
#   wrapped_cmd || err=$?  # then do something with $err

# prints the usage info of the executed script. The usage information must be
# put in the script using comments starting with "##"
print_usage() {
  grep '^##' "${TOP_SCRIPT}" | cut -c4-
