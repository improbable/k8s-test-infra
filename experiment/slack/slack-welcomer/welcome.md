Welcome to Slack!

This is a _welcome message_. It is formatted using `mrkdwn`, which is like Markdown but not.

You can references users and channels and they should be linkified: #testing-things

You can read the <https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md|Code of Conduct>.
That wasn't very markdown but oh well.

Obviously, this is placeholder text.
